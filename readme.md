Multivariate Normal Inverse Gaussian (MNIG)
======================================

Main reference:  Oigard, Hanssen, Hansen, Godtliebsen - EM-estimation and modeling of heavy-tailed processes with the multivariate normal inverse Gaussian distribution.


Define and fit MNIG distributions using EM ;
if possible, expand it to add a noise term.

The purpose is a better fit for Gaussian scale mixture models.

Work in progress!
